## Discussed

- Contact information. Some members of Core team were reporting that they still lacked access to email contact list for team leaders who had expressed interest in taking part (although this had already been granted). They subsequently confirmed that they did have access. Need to make sure list is not copied to any other repository without observing GDPR requirements.

- Bank account signatories. Trustees unanimously agreed to appoint Rich as Secretary of Student Robotics. This position required to effect bank account changes. We will hopefully be able to sign paper work when we meet in person.

- Core Team. The first monthly progress report was received. In conjunction with online meeting minutes, we were happy with level of information. There was some concern that core team was very Southampton-centric, but we agreed that, in the interest of having a competition running this year, the cohesiveness of the team delivering was paramount.

- Fundraising. Agreed that we would make this a priority. Diane will contact Motorola about ongoing (and maybe increased) funding – Rich to send contact details. Diane will also contact Gatwick Diamond (a consortium of businesses clustered around Gatwick) and PA Consulting. David will contact IET and also Cambridge Angels (another business consortium). Rich to pursue contact at Winton (investment company). Jimmy will continue to investigate lottery funding.

- Finance. Di has been working on getting data out of Ledger and into a more user friendly finance system. Rich exported CSV file to speed up process.

- Meeting. Agreed that we would meet in person in London so that we can go through the IT systems; meeting to take place on 25th. Rich will book venue; budget of £100 unanimously agreed.
