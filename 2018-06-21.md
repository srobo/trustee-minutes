    - https://hackmd.io/kqF0TNogSLmeIcNpGclooA?view#
  - A Google Document has been made to collaborate on answers
  - JT: "It feels like a lot of their points stem from a lack of ownership and
     engagement in SR"
  - DM: "It looks like we're very compatible in terms of our vision and values"

### Actions

- DD - Attend SourceBots meeting on the 23rd June.

## The Core Team

- How will Trustees work with the Core Team
  - What do we _need_ to do?
    - Look after the money.
    - Make sure the charity's objectives are met.
  - What will we expect them to do?
    - Some kind of reporting?
    - We should make sure they meet up, and write minutes.
    - They'll need to prepare a budget.
      - We should likely "approve" it, or at least sense check it.
      - We should probably help them make it, since we've done it before.

- What should the Core Team look like?
  - We want to be a national organisation, it should reflect that
    - JT: "Even the North"
      - DD: "We have a Core Team applicant at Durham"
    - Maybe a different person for each region?
    - Needs more thought, can be flexible.
    - If SourceBots want to merge in, how would this work?
      - The Core Team can't consist of _only_ SourceBots folks, this limits our
        physical reach.
      - Some should be invited to the Core Team, the rest can fill roles in the
        charity as defined by the Core Team.

## Future Availability
